## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This application requires a running local or production version of the web API it was built around. Here is the code for the API:

- [Just Files Web API GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dacrands/s3-upload-backend)


You will also need Node and npm downloaded to support this application. 

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

$ npm i
```

## Serve the App


### Development

Visit your site at *http://localhost:8000*

## Deployment

This is a static site and can be hosted on many services. Here are two options I really enjoy using:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

## Built With

* [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
