A file-hosting application that emphasizes simplicity and accessibility.

## Description
This is the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) front-end for a file-hosting application I am developing. Partially inspired by the [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com) site, the UI strives to emphasize simplicity and accessibility. Google, Dropbox, etc. all offer excellent file-hosting services, but they don't offer true simplicity. Sometimes you just want a simple online-folder to hold the files you use most often, or least often, without having to navigate through folders. Additionally, the complexity of applications such as Google Drive may lead to accessibility issues for certain users, such as those with limited computer skills. 

### How did you emphasize accessibility?
The UI is completely tabbable by design. In fact, I somethimes prefer navigating the application using entirely the keyboard. `focus` is maintained on all actionable elements and `aria-labels` are used on buttons and inputs with non-text values (e.g., 	
&#9998;, 	&#10005;). The black and white color theme provides excellent color contrast, and the colors <strong style="color: #224adb">blue</strong> and <strong style="color: red;">red</strong> are used to indicate action.

### Why Gatsby?
I love using Gatsby because I love React and free hosting.
